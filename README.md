# Weather-App

The Weather App is a dynamic and user-friendly web application that allows users to get real-time weather information for different cities across the world. The application is built with a simple and clean user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and understand the information presented.
## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
* WHEN I search for a city
* THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
* THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city


## Description
The development of a weather dashboard has proven to be an excellent opportunity for me to put my coding skills to the test and experiment with server-side APIs. I started the project by utilizing the location API provided by Open Weather. Upon entering the city name, the dashboard was able to retrieve its latitude and longitude, which were then used to fetch the weather API from Open Weather. With this information, I was ready to create the new DOM elements to display the current weather and five-day forecast.

One challenge that arose during the project was saving city information without duplication. I managed to resolve this issue at the end, but I aim to improve this in the future. Another problem I had was display local storage, I do spend lots of time on it and gain a lot.

This project has been my favorite so far and has been an enjoyable experience. I now feel comfortable working with server-side APIs and am excited about the endless possibilities for future projects.
